Portal File Fixer 
----------------------------

This is a really small and simple to use.

Step by step guide to getting the portal 2 models working in gmod (skip the first bit if you have already done it)

Firstly extract the models and materials from the Portal 2 VPK file into a gmod addon folder (Create an info.txt for it)
Run the batch file mentioned in this thread http://www.facepunch.com/threads/642683-Step-by-Step-for-adding-L4D-models-to-Gmod 
It must be run from INSIDE of your models folder 

Once you have run that you can run this program, the instructions are quite simple. Simply paste in the path to your Portal 2 
materials folder 
(For example C:\Program Files (x86)\steam\steamapps\Username\garrysmod\garrysmod\addons\Portal2\materials)
If you do not go directly to the materials folder it may take a long time (Just doing my portal2 folder took me 5 mins as opposed 
to 30 seconds for just the material folder)

Once you have told the program the folder you want it to do, just sit back and wait. Once its done it will tell you.

Credit

Credit really should go to both "Matsilagi" and "ben1066" as they pointed out which value needed changing in the files. I simply
made this small program to automate it.
